    # How To: Private Message

    Private messages are special channels with the restricted `io.pnut.core.pm` channel type. They cannot be directly created or deactivated, 
    and they're completely immutable (you cannot change who is included in the channel). This makes the "owner" of the channel irrelevant.

    ## Creation

    Channel creation is handled by Pnut.

    ## Sending a Message

    To send a message to other users, you need to know all of the users you will be sending the message to, or the ID of an already-created channel. 
    If you know the channel, you may create a message in it just like you would any other channel. If you do not, or it has not been created yet, 
    you can create an `application/json`-encoded message with the `channel_id` of "pm", and a special list in the JSON of `destinations`, 
    listing all users by "@username" or their user ID.

    In every other way, they can be treated like other channels and messages. Note that the "owner's" ID will not be in the write-access ACL, 
    but they will not function any differently from anyone else.

    ## Existing PM Channels

    If you want to see a PM channel between specific users without sending a message, you can use the Existing PM endpoint to find the channel ID.
