    # How To Manage Channel Permissions

    Channels have three groups that determine who can read, write, and manage the channel: `full`, `write`, `read`.

    Users can't be in multiple groups. The higher-access groups inherit the lower functionality as well; someone who can manage a channel can write and read, and someone who can write, can read.

    The user who creates the channel automatically has `full` access, but is the `user` in the channel object, not in the ACL proper. The owner can be changed later.

    ## Permissions

    ### user
    * Deactivate the channel
    * Edit `full` access group
    * Change the owner of the channel

    ### full
    * Edit the channel and the `read` and `write` ACLs
    * Delete any messages from the channel

    ### write
    * Write messages to the channel

    ### read
    * Read and subscribe to the channel and messages in it

    ## Immutability

    By default, all ACLs are "mutable". They can change. Once set "*im*mutable", they can no longer be changed.

    The exception to this is `read.any_user`, which will still inherit `write.any_user` changing to `true` even if `read.immutable: true`.

    When you create a channel, be sure not to make an ACL immutable if you think you will want to change it later.
