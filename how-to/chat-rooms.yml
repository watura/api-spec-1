    # How To Create a Chat Room

    Chat rooms are a special core Pnut channel type, `io.pnut.core.chat`. They can be searched by category in addition to the ways 
    other channels can be searched, and also have first-party E-mail notification support.

    * [Channel type](https://github.com/pnut-api/object-metadata/blob/master/channel-types/io.pnut.core.chat.md)

    The channel will have to be created with the `io.pnut.core.chat-settings` raw item.

    * [Chat Settings type](https://github.com/pnut-api/object-metadata/blob/master/raw/io.pnut.core.chat-settings.md)

    Creating a chat room is executed like any other channel, with POST /channels.

    ### Optional Improvements to Rooms

    #### Image for the Room

    Images representing the room may be added with the [avatar image](https://github.com/pnut-api/object-metadata/blob/master/raw/io.pnut.core.channel.avatar.md) 
    and [cover image](https://github.com/pnut-api/object-metadata/blob/master/raw/io.pnut.core.channel.cover.md).

    #### Broadcast to Global

    Clients often allow users to "broadcast" a message from a public channel to the Global post stream.

    To do that, create a post with a [channel invite](https://github.com/pnut-api/object-metadata/blob/master/raw/io.pnut.core.channel.invite.md) 
    attached, referencing the channel ID.

    Then create an identical message in the channel, with a [broadcast notice](https://github.com/pnut-api/object-metadata/blob/master/raw/net.patter-app.broadcast.md) 
    on it referencing the ID of the post that was just created.
