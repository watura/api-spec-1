  title: Channel ACL
  description: |
    # How To: ACL

    Channels have three groups that determine who can read, write, and manage the channel. Users can't be in multiple groups. The higher-access groups inherit the lower functionality as well; someone who can manage a channel can write and read, and someone who can write, can read. The user who creates the channel automatically and irrevocably has `full` access, but is the `owner` user in the channel object, not in the ACL proper.

    ## Permissions

    ### owner
    * Deactivate the channel.
    * Edit `full` access group.

    ### full
    * Edit the channel and the `read` and `write` ACLs
    * Delete any messages from the channel.

    ### write
    * Write messages to the channel.

    ### read
    * Read and subscribe to the channel and messages in it.

    ## Immutability

    By default, all ACLs are "mutable". They can change. Once set "*im*mutable", they can no longer be changed. The exception to this is `any_user` on `read`. If `any_user` on `write` changes from false to true, `read`'s `any_user` will still inherit it.

    When you create a channel, be sure not to make an ACL immutable if you think you will want to change it later.
