        Retrieve the status of a long-running operation.
        
        Currently the only API call that creates a long-running operation is deleting multiple files, type `FileDelete`.
        
        `ended_at` will only be set if the operation has completed. `status` will be one of `running`, `dead`, and `completed`. 
        `dead` is not definitive, but if `dead`, something went wrong.
